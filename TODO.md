# Todo

- [ ] Add type checking (all properties are not null and inputs are valid to the model) on Product controller methods.
- [ ] Add authentication
- [ ] this.data on product-controller class are memory storage, being read from the classes state, not the database each time this.data is called, look into making that a full-on class instead (then having to put json data into the this.writeData() function)
